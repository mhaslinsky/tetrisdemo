# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a web-based Tetris game built with Next.js and React. The game will implement classic Tetris gameplay mechanics with modern web technologies, providing an engaging and responsive gaming experience that works across different devices and browsers. The implementation will follow standard Tetris rules while incorporating modern UI/UX principles and accessibility features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Game Board and Visual Display

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a clear game board with falling tetromino pieces, so that I can play the game effectively and track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display a 10×20 grid game board

3. WHEN blocks are placed on the board THEN the system SHALL display them as filled cells with appropriate colors
4. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL show the current score, level, and lines cleared
5. WHEN a new piece is generated THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the next piece
6. IF the game supports hold functionality THEN the system SHALL display the held piece in a separate preview area

### Requirement 2: Tetromino Piece Movement and Controls

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control tetromino pieces using keyboard inputs, so that I can position and rotate pieces strategically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses the left arrow key THEN the system SHALL move the active piece one cell to the left
2. WHEN the player presses the right arrow key THEN the system SHALL move the active piece one cell to the right
3. WHEN the player presses the down arrow key THEN the system SHALL accelerate the piece's downward movement (soft drop)
4. WHEN the player presses the up arrow key or spacebar THEN the system SHALL rotate the active piece clockwise
5. WHEN the player presses a designated hard drop key THEN the system SHALL instantly drop the piece to the lowest possible position
6. WHEN a movement would cause a collision THEN the system SHALL prevent the movement and keep the piece in its current position
7. WHEN rotation would cause a collision THEN the system SHALL attempt wall kicks before preventing the rotation

### Requirement 3: Line Clearing and Scoring

**User Story:** As a player, I want completed horizontal lines to be cleared and scored, so that I can progress in the game and achieve high scores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a horizontal line is completely filled with blocks THEN the system SHALL clear that line
2. WHEN multiple lines are completed simultaneously THEN the system SHALL clear all completed lines
3. WHEN lines are cleared THEN the system SHALL drop all blocks above the cleared lines down by the appropriate number of rows
4. WHEN a single line is cleared THEN the system SHALL award 100 × current level points
5. WHEN two lines are cleared simultaneously THEN the system SHALL award 300 × current level points
6. WHEN three lines are cleared simultaneously THEN the system SHALL award 500 × current level points
7. WHEN four lines are cleared simultaneously (Tetris) THEN the system SHALL award 800 × current level points
8. WHEN lines are cleared THEN the system SHALL increment the total lines cleared counter
9. WHEN the total lines cleared reaches multiples of 10 THEN the system SHALL increase the game level

### Requirement 4: Game Progression and Difficulty

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to become progressively more challenging, so that I remain engaged and motivated to improve my skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL begin at level 1
2. WHEN 10 lines are cleared THEN the system SHALL advance to the next level
3. WHEN the level increases THEN the system SHALL increase the speed at which pieces fall
4. WHEN a piece is soft dropped THEN the system SHALL award 1 point per cell dropped
5. WHEN a piece is hard dropped THEN the system SHALL award 2 points per cell dropped
6. WHEN the game level increases THEN the system SHALL update the display to show the new level

### Requirement 5: Game State Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to properly manage game states (playing, paused, game over), so that I have control over my gaming session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL initialize in a "ready to play" state
2. WHEN the player starts playing THEN the system SHALL transition to "playing" state
3. WHEN the player pauses the game THEN the system SHALL freeze all game mechanics and display a pause indicator
4. WHEN the game is paused and the player resumes THEN the system SHALL continue from the exact state before pausing
5. WHEN a new piece cannot be placed at the spawn position THEN the system SHALL trigger game over state
6. WHEN the game is over THEN the system SHALL display the final score and provide an option to restart
7. WHEN the player chooses to restart THEN the system SHALL reset all game state to initial values

### Requirement 6: Collision Detection and Physics

**User Story:** As a player, I want pieces to behave realistically with proper collision detection, so that the game feels responsive and fair.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a piece reaches the bottom of the board THEN the system SHALL lock it in place
2. WHEN a piece collides with an existing block below THEN the system SHALL lock the active piece
3. WHEN a piece tries to move outside the left or right boundaries THEN the system SHALL prevent the movement
4. WHEN a piece tries to rotate into an occupied space THEN the system SHALL attempt wall kick adjustments
5. IF wall kicks are not possible THEN the system SHALL prevent the rotation
6. WHEN a piece is locked THEN the system SHALL immediately spawn the next piece at the top center of the board
7. WHEN collision detection occurs THEN the system SHALL process it within the same frame to prevent visual glitches

### Requirement 7: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a player, I want an intuitive and visually appealing interface, so that I can focus on gameplay without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern interface with clear visual hierarchy
2. WHEN displaying game information THEN the system SHALL show score, level, lines cleared, and next piece in dedicated areas
3. WHEN the game is active THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback for user actions
4. WHEN lines are cleared THEN the system SHALL provide visual animation or feedback
5. WHEN the game is paused THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the paused state
6. WHEN displaying controls THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for keyboard controls
7. IF the device supports touch THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly controls as an alternative

### Requirement 8: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to run smoothly without lag or performance issues, so that I can enjoy uninterrupted gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent frame rates above 30 FPS
2. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL respond within 16ms for smooth interaction
3. WHEN rendering the game board THEN the system SHALL optimize rendering to prevent unnecessary re-draws
